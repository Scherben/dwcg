This Repository is a student project of mine. It is about the generation and creation of a P&P-character for the roleplaying game Deathwatch from FFG. 
At the moment this repository will not be maintained. The underlying rulesystem tends to be very complex and its implementation just for the creation of a character is difficult. 

Maybe, as time goes by, I will continue the development. If I get enough feedback or help with the problem of storing the data (DB or XML or smth else, and this decision is not an easy one), that will be also a fact which will let me concur the development. 

For now, this project is on hold. Feel free to copy and share it as you like, but be aware that this tool is by far not finished and needs a lot of work.
